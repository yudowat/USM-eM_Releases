<h2>USM-eM for Nintendo 3DS Installation Instructions:</h2>
<p><b>Prerequisites:</b><br>
   - The latest version of USM-eM 3DS; get it from <a href="releases.html">the downloads page</a>.
   - A 3DS or N3DS with arm9loaderhax*; a HBL version will be coming soon but for now CFW is required. Info on installation can be found <a href="https://plailect.github.io/Guide/">here</a>.
<br>
   - The latest version of <a href="https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/releases/">Luma3DS</a>.<br>
   - The latest version of <a href="http://titledb.com/">Smash-Selector</a> from TitleDB, as GBATemp builds are currently broken.<br><br>

<b>Instructions</b><br>
   - From the Luma3DS .7z file you downloaded, extract the arm9loaderhax.bin to the root of your SD card. Overwrite the old one.<br>
   - Make a folder called “SaltySD” on the root of your SD card. Within that folder, make a folder called “smash”.<br>
   - Open the latest USM-eM release for 3DS zip file. Inside it, open the “3DS” folder. Extract the folders in here to the “smash” folder you just created.<br>
   - Extract the Smash-Selector.cia file to the root of your SD card.<br>
   - Re-insert the SD card into your 3DS, and hold Select while booting to access the Luma3DS configuration menu.<br>
   - Navigate to “Enable region/language emulation and external .code” and press A to turn it on.<br>
   - Press Start to save the config and reboot your console.<br>
   - Open FBI, select SD, and locate the Smash-Selector.cia file you extracted earlier. Select it and install it.<br>
   - Close FBI, and a new icon should appear on the HOME menu.<br>
   - Open this present, and open Smash-Selector.<br>
   - Once Smash-Selector has opened, press Select to download the latest SaltySD files. This will take a while, but wait for it to go through every region before preceeding. (JAP, USA, EUR)<br>
   - Press Y to select SaltySD rather than regular Smash4.<br>
   - Make sure that "Slot 1" is selected, and the description is "USM-eM - Alpha3", then load Smash!<br>
   - The title screen should now show the USM-eM logo rather than the default logo, this means the mod loaded properly!<br>
   - From now on, boot Smash-Selector instead of the regular Smash icon when you want to start Smash. Press X in the Smash-Selector menu to select regular Smash 3DS and Y to select USM-eM. If you boot the regular icon, it will remember your last option selected in Smash-Selector- for example, if you’ve selected USM-eM in Smash-Selector and then used the regular icon, it will boot USM-eM until you change it in Smash-Selector.<br>
   <br><i>*Note that while other outdated methods of booting CFW, like menuhax or the MSET (DS Profile) exploit will work, arm9loaderhax is recommended due to its superiority.</i>
 </p>

<b>Instructions</b><br>
  - Go to <a href="releases.html">the downloads page</a> and download the latest build for your region on Wii U<br>
  - Open the archive and move the "3DS" folder to the saltySD folder on your SD card.<br>
  - Rename the "3DS" folder to "smash" if you aren't using Smash-Selector, but if you are using Smash-Selector, you should know what to do.<br>
